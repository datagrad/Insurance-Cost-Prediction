# Insurance-Cost-Prediction
A predictive model to predict the insurance charges of individuals under certain conditions.

With this project we will be creating a machine learning model to be used by insurance companies to determine the annual insurance cost of a person based on the attributes like:
1.	Gender
2.	Age
3.	BMI
4.	Number of Children
5.	Smoking Habit
6.	Residence


The complete project is done in following steps:
1.	Exploring and cleaning the dataset
2.	Data preparation for training
3.	Creating a Machine Learning model
4.	Training the model to fit the data
5.	Making predictions using the trained model


## Result
Created Linear Regression and Random Forest Model.
The Random Forest Regressor gave an accurate figure with the best performance.
The Random Forest Regressor gave an R_squared of 97.6%. It means, 97.6% of the observed variation can be explained by the model's inputs.
The Linear Regression had an R_squared of 74%, which means, 74% of the observed variation can be explained by the model's inputs.
